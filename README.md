# NLPwithR

This project authored by Marcel Schweiker conducts a sentiment analysis of two opposing and bipolar opinion pieces on the topic of election right legislation in the USA. It aims to try out different lexica and methods to extract insights from the sentiments within the articles. More on the project objectives, materials, execution and concludion can be found in the attached report.

Since the RScript scrapes the data used for the analysis from the web, no further external input data is needed to run the programm. For running the RScript, a suitable environment like the RStudio workbench can be used. Please ensure to have the necessary dependencies installed before running the code. Commands to install all necessary dependencies are provided in the head of the RScript in form of comments.
